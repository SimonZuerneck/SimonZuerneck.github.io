# About me

<img src="/assets/Picture_Zuerneck_NHH.jpg" alt="Simon Zuerneck" width="200" style="border-radius:50%;">

Hei! I am Simon, a PhD Research Scholar in Economics at the Norwegian School of Economics, affiliated with [FAIR - Center for Experimental Research on Fairness, Inequality and Rationality](https://www.nhh.no/en/research-centres/fair/).

I hold an M.Sc. in Economics from the University of Helsinki, Finland, and a B.Sc. in International Economics from the Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen, Germany. My research interests include the economics of education, the determinants of successful labour market integration of workers with a migration background, and microeconomic theory. 

I have previously worked as a Research Assistant at the Institute for Applied Economic Research in Tübingen and completed internships at the ifo Center for the Economics of Education in Munich and at Deutsche Bundesbank (German Federal Bank)

I am based in Bergen, Norway, but during the semester break, you can find me in Frankfurt, Germany, and occasionally in Athens, Greece. Feel free to reach out at [Simon.Zuerneck@nhh.no](mailto:Simon.Zuerneck@nhh.no]).
